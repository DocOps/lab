= Ruby Development Style Guide

This guide outlines the Ruby coding styles and conventions used in DocOps Lab projects.


[[automated-style-enforcement]]
== Automated Style Enforcement

DocOps Lab projects using the `docopslab-dev` gem automatically enforce Ruby style guidelines through:

RuboCop:: Automated code style checking and auto-fixing
Git Hooks:: Pre-commit advisory checks, pre-push quality gates
CI/CD Integration:: Automated linting in GitHub Actions workflows

To apply style fixes: `bundle exec rake labdev:heal:ruby`

See {xref_docs_lab-dev-usage_link} for setup details.

[[conventions]]
== Conventions

DocOps Lab largely follows Ruby's community conventions, with some exceptions.
Conventions are either reiterated or clarified here.

However, conventions are not exhaustively listed, and deviations are rarely pointed out as such.

[[naming-conventions]]
=== Naming Conventions

* Use `snake_case` for variable and method names.
* Use `CamelCase` for class and module names.
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
* Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable, method, or class.
* Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.
* Use verbs for method names to indicate actions.
* Use nouns for class and module names to indicate entities.

[[architectural-conventions]]
=== Architectural Conventions

* Use classes and class instance methods for objects that work like _objects_ -- they have state and do not act on other objects' state.
* Use module methods acting on objects or carrying out general operations/utility functions.
* Use Rake for internal (developer) CLI; use Thor for user-facing CLI
* Gems may begin life as a module within another gem.

[[path-conventions]]
=== Path Conventions

* Use `lib/` for main application code.
** `lib/<project_name>.rb` for the main file
** `lib/<project_name>/` for supporting files and modules
** `lib/<project_name>/<module_name>/` for submodules
* Use `spec/` for specifications and tests.
* Use `docs/` or `_docs/` for documentation.
* Use `build/` for pre-runtime artifacts.
* Use `_build/` as default in applications that generate files at runtime, unless another path is more appropriate (ex: `_site/` in Jekyll-centric apps).
* Do NOT assume or insist upon perfect alignment with Ruby path conventions:
** `SomeModule` or `SomeClass` may be sourced at `lib/some_module.rb` or `lib/some_class.rb` instead of `lib/some/module.rb` or `lib/some/class.rb`.
** Some modules like `SchemaGraphy` and `AsciiDoc` are never broken up into `schema_graphy` or `ascii_doc` namespaces.
** Modules with multiple parallel sibling modules in a category like (`WriteOps`, `DraftOps`) belong in paths like `lib/ops/write.rb` instead of `lib/write_ops.rb` or `lib/write/ops.rb`.

[[syntax-conventions]]
=== Syntax Conventions

* Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Limit lines to 120 characters or so when possible.
* Use parentheses for method calls with arguments, but omit them for methods without arguments.
* Do not use parentheses in method definitions (`def method_name arg1, arg2`).
* Use single quotes for strings that do not require interpolation or special symbols.
* Use double quotes for strings that require interpolation or special symbols.

[[commenting-conventions]]
=== Commenting Conventions

See {xref_docs_code-commenting_link} for detailed commenting conventions.

[[rubocop-customization]]
== RuboCop Customization

[TIP]
These rules ("`cops`") can be overridden on a per-project basis in the `.config/rubocop.yml` file.
See <<config-rubocop>> for docopslab-dev-managed RuboCop configuration.
