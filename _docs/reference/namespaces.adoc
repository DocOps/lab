.Namespaces and namespace semantics
****
One of the most complicated aspects of programming is maintaining consistent naming conventions (and names) across all products and interfaces without straying too far from domain conventions and standards.

Take the term "`domain`", for instance.
In the previous paragraph, I used _domain_ to refer to the "`field`" or "`industry`" or "`genre`" in which a given product is likely to be associated with.
Yet of course, _domain_ has other technical meanings.
Not only is it a networking term referring to a string like `example.com` and its implications, but in programming a _domain_ can also refer to a "`bounded context`" for components or interfaces of a certain product.

In the (industrial) "`domain`" of _open-source technical documentation software_, there are many intersecting "`namespaces`" that require careful naming of their member "`elements`".

For instance, terms like _document "`generation`"_, _document "`conversion`"_, _document "`rendering`"_, _document "`building`"_, document "`compiling`".
In software, most of these terms have a parallel for the application source code, as well.
Software gets "`compiled`" and "`built`", for sure.

So when naming commands, functions, methods, and so forth, verbs like _build_, _render_, _convert_, and so forth all have specific meanings.
And they may not correspond perfectly with what a downstream user will understand as the meaning of that term in _their_ domain (their field).

This is as true for when the downstream user is a _developer_ integrating with or extending your product (API endpoints, parameter labels, etc, etc), or an _end-user_ dealing with UIs (CLI commands and options, form or GUI labels, menu items, etc, etc).

All of these are _terms of art_, in that they are relatively common words that have a particular meaning in a particular domain.
Nevertheless, the programmer's job is to maintain a consistent "`grammar`" when it comes to naming _things_, whether those things are fully internal or they're user-facing, and regardless of the domain context.
