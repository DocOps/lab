= README-driven Development

DocOps Lab practices software development that revolves around `README.adoc` and uses other AsciiDoc and YAML files to radically single source all product and documentation code.

We will eventually provide detailed documentation of the conventions and protocols involved in this method.

For now, Agents should:

* Peruse the local `README.adoc` and `specs/data/*.{yml,yaml}`
* Prompt their Operators to provide examples from relevant/neighboring projects.
