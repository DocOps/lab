= Overview of Common Paths/Files in DocOps Lab Projects

_If you are creating a new DocOPs Lab project_, use this guide to establish initial files.
This also applies to adding major facilities or features to an existing project.

_If you are just getting to know a DocOps Lab codebase_, favor the project's `README.adoc` file over this guide.
