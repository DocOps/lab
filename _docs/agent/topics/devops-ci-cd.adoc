= AI Agent Orientation to DocOps Lab DevOps/CI/CD Practices

DocOps Lab is in a very nascent stage of establishing shared (cross-repo) tools, workflows, and protocols to for automating development, integration, build, and deployment processes.

DocOps Lab uses GitHub Actions and Docker as primary platforms for integration and deployment automation.

For now you can get a good idea for getting started with automation by checking the standard paths in the current project (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflos/`, `Rakefile`, `scripts/`) as well as looking at similar DocOps Lab projects that have more established CI/CD workflows.

The rest of this document is snippets from various relevant internal documentation.
