= MISSION: Start a New DocOps Lab Project

An AI Agent or multiple Agents, in collaboration with a human Operator, can initialize and prepare a codebase for a new DocOps Lab project.

This codebase can be based on an existing specification document, or one can be drafted during this procedure.


== Agent Roles

The following agent roles will take a turn at steps in this mission.

planner/architect (optional)::
If there is no specification yet, this agent works with the Operator and any relevant documentation to draft a project specification and/or definition documents.

product engineer::
Initialize the basic environment and dependencies; oversee DevOps, DocOps, and QA contributions; wireframe/scaffold basic library structure.

QA/testing engineer::
Set up testing frameworks and initial/demonstrative test cases.

DevOps/release engineer::
Set up CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure as code.

project manager::
Review the initial project setup; create initial work issues and tasks for further development.

tech writer::
Assist in writing/reviewing specification docs and README. 

=== Context Management for Multi-role Sessions

include::_common.adoc[tag="context-management"]

=== Task Assignments and Suggestions

include::_common.adoc[tag="task-metadata"]

== Prerequisite: Attention OPERATOR

This process requires the `docopslab-dev` tooling is installed and synced, or at the very least the `.agent/docs/` library maintained by that tool be in place.

For unorthodox projects, simply copying an up-to-date version of that library to your project root directory should suffice.


== Mission Procedure

In general, the following stages are to be followed in order and tracked in a mission document.

=== Stage 0: Mission Prep

Create a mission-tracking document::
Write a document with detailed steps for fulfilling the mission assigned here, based on any project-specific context that might rule in or out some of the following stages or steps.
(`role: project-manager; path: .agent/project-setup-mission.md`)

=== Evergreen Tasks

The following tasks apply to most stages.

Keep the mission-tracking document up to date::
At the end of every stage, update the progress.
(`path: .agent/project-setup-mission.md`)

Perform tests as needed::
Run tests to ensure the initial setup is functioning as expected.
(`role: qa-testing-engineer; read: [.agent/docs/skills/tests-running.md, specs/tests/README.adoc]`)

Update docs as needed::
Continuously improve the relevant `README.adoc` and other documentation based on new insights or changes in the project setup.
(`role: tech-writer; read: .agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md, paths: [README.adoc, specs/docs/\**/*.adoc, specs/tests/README.adoc]`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Project Specification

Specification review::
_If the project already contains one or more specification documents (`specs/docs/*.adoc`) and/or an extensive `README.adoc` file_, review them for thoroughness and advise of missing information, ambiguities, inconsistencies, and potential pitfalls.
(`role: planner-architect; with: operator; upto: [product-engineer, product-manager]`)

Draft a specification::
_If no specification and no detailed `README.adoc` exists_, work with the Operator to draft a basic project specification/requirements document in AsciiDoc and data/interface definition files in YAML/SGYML.
(`role: planner-architect; with: [product-manager, tech-writer]; upto: product-developer; read: [.agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/schemagraphy-sgyml.md], path: specs/docs/<subject-slug>-requirements.adoc`)

Create/enrich README::
The `README.adoc` file is _the_ primary document for every DocOps Lab repo.
Make it great.
(`role: tech-writer; with: [planner-architect, product-manager]; upto: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md`, path: `README.adoc`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Codebase/Environment Setup

Establish initial files::
Create the basic project directory structure and initial files, including `README.adoc`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `Rakefile`, along with any necessary configuration files.
(`role: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/topics/common-project-paths.md`)

Establish versioning::
Define the revision code (probably `0.1.0`) in the `README.adoc` and make sure the base module/code reads it from there as SSoT.
(`role: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md; path: README.adoc`)

Populate initial files::
Fill in the initial files with dependency requirements, boilerplate content, placeholder comments, project description, based on the Specification.
(`role: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/code-commenting.md`, path: `[Rakefile, .gitignore, lib/**, <product-slug>.gemspec, etc]`)

Instantiate environment/dependencies::
Install dependency libraries (usually `bundle install`, `npm install`, and so forth).
(`role: product-engineer)

Update the README::
Add relevant details from this stage to the project's `README.adoc` file.
Include basic setup/quickstart instructions for developers.
(`role: product-engineer; upto: tech-writer; read: .agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md`, path: `README.adoc`)

Commit to Git::
Test the `.gitignore` and any pre-commit hooks by adding and committing files.
Adjust `.gitignore` as needed and amend commits until correct.
(`role: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/git.md;`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Testing Framework Setup

Create basic testing scaffold::
Prompt the Operator to provide relevant examples from similar repos and modify it for the current project's use case.
(`role: qa-testing-engineer; with: operator; upto: product-engineer; read: [README.adoc, specs/ .agent/docs/skills/tests-writing.md, .agent/docs/skills/rake-cli-dev.md]; path: specs/tests/`)

Populate initial test cases::
Draft initial test cases that cover basic functionality and edge cases based on the project specification.
(`role: qa-testing-engineer; upto: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/tests-writing.md; paths: specs/tests/rspec/`)

Create a testing README::
Draft the initial docs for the testing regimen.
(`role: qa-testing-engineer; upto: tech-writer; read: .agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md`, path: `specs/tests/README.adoc`)

Update the project README::
Make a note of the tests path and docs in the main `README.adoc` file. (`role: qa-testing-engineer; upto: tech-writer; read: .agent/docs/skills/asciidoc.md, .agent/docs/skills/readme-driven-dev.md`, path: `README.adoc`)

Commit to Git::
Add and commit testing files to Git.

Commit to Git::
Add and commit CI/CD files to Git.
(`role: devops-release-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/git.md;`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Initial Product Code

Write code to initial tests::
Implement the minimum viable code to pass the initial test cases.
(`+++role: product-engineer; with: [Operator, qa-testing-engineer]; read: [specs/tests/rspec/**, specs/docs/*.adoc]; upto: [qa-testing-engineer, devops-release-engineer]; paths: [lib/**, specs/tests/rspec/**]+++`)

Commit to Git::
Add and commit the initial product code to Git.
(`role: product-engineer; read: .agent/docs/skills/git.md;`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Review Initial Project Setup

Review mission report::

Triage these and consider invoking new roles to fulfill the steps.
(`role: project-manager; with: Operator; read: .agent/project-setup-mission.md; path: .agent/reports/project-setup-mission.md`)

Check project against README and specs::
Read through the relevant specifications to ensure at least the _scaffolding_ to meet the project requirements is in place.
Take note of any place the codebase falls short.
(`+++role: project-manager; read: [README.adoc, specs/**/*.{adoc,yml,yaml}]; upto: [planner-architect, product-engineer, qa-testing-engineer, devops-release-engineer]; path: .agent/reports/project-setup-mission.md; with: Operator+++`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Agent Documentation

Draft an AGENTS.md file from template::
Use the `AGENTS.markdown` file available through `docopslab-dev` (sync initially, then set `sync: false` in `.config/docopslab-dev.yml`).
Follow the instructions in the doc to transform it into a localized edition of the prime doc.
(`role: Agent; path: AGENTS.adoc`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Squash and Push to GitHUb

Push to GitHub::
Push the local repository to a new remote GitHub repository.

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Configure GH Issues Board

Set up GH Issues facility for the project::
Use `gh` tool or instruct the Operator to use the GH Web UI to prepare the Issues facility.
Make sure to set up appropriate labels and milestones, and ensure API read/write access.
(`role: project-manager; read: [.agent/docs/skills/github-issues.md];`)

=== Stage {counter:stage}: Create Initial Work Issues

Draft an IMYML file::
Add all the issues to a scratch file in IMYML format.
(`role: project-manager; read: .agent/docs/skills/github-issues.md; path: .agent/scratch/initial-issues.yml; with: Operator`)

Bulk create initial issues::
Use the `issuer` tool to generate remote GH Issues entries based on the issues draft file.
(`role: project-manager; cmds: 'bundle exec issuer --help'; path: .agent/scratch/initial-issues.yml; upto: [product-engineer, tech-writer, devops-release-engineer, qa-testing-engineer, docops-engineer]`)

=== Post-mission Debriefing

Review Mission Report::
Highlight outstanding or special notices from the Mission Report.
(`role: Agent; with: Operator; read: .agent/reports/project-setup-mission.md`)

Suggest modifications to _this_ mission assignment::
Taking into account any bumps, blockers, or unexpected occurrences during fulfillment of this mission, recommend changes or additions to *"`{doctitle}`"* itself.
Put yourself in the shoes of a future agent facing down an unknown project.
(`role: Agent; with: Operator; path: ../lab/_docs/agent/missions/setup-new-project.adoc`).


== Fulfillment Principles

=== ALWAYS

include::_common.adoc[tag="always"]

=== NEVER

include::_common.adoc[tag="never"]

=== Quality Bar

A good output is a codebase that a human engineer could pick up and continue developing with minimal onboarding due to logical structure and conventions as well as clear documentation of the architecture, setup process, and project-specific considerations.
