By default will be up to the Agent to decide whether to hand off to a concurrent or subsequent Agent or "`upgrade`" role/skills during a session.

The Operator may of course dictate or override this decision.

The goal is to use appropriate agents without cluttering any given agent's context window.

Soft-reset between roles::
At each transition, declare what you're loading (role doc + skills) and what you're backgrounding.
Don't hold all previous stage details in active memory.

Mission tracker as swap file::
Dump detailed handoff notes into `.agent/project-setup-mission.md` after each stage.
Read it first when starting new roles to understand what was built and what's needed.

Checkpoint between stages::
After each stage, ask Operator to review/continue/pause.
Creates intervention points if focus dilutes.

Watch for dilution::
Mixing concerns across roles, contradicting earlier decisions, hedging instead of checking files.
If noticed, stop and checkpoint.

Focused lenses::
Each role emphasizes different details (Product Engineer = code structure, QA = test coverage, DevOps = automation, PM = coordination).
Switch lenses deliberately; shared base knowledge (README, goals, conventions) stays warm.

// tag::always[]
* Always ask the Operator when you don't know exactly how DocOps Lab prefers a step be carried out.
* Always follow the mission procedure as closely as possible, adapting only when necessary due to project-specific constraints.
* Always document any deviations from the standard procedure and the reasons for them in the Mission Report.
* Always look for a DRY way to define product metadata/attrbutes in README.adoc and YAML files (`specs/data/*-def.yml`).
* Always pause for Operator approval before ANY publishing or deployment action, including pushing/posting to GitHub.
// end::always[]

// tag::never[]
* Never get creative or innovative without Operator permission.
* Never skip steps in the mission procedure without documenting the reason.
* Never assume the Operator understands DocOps Lab conventions without explanation.
// end::never[]

// tag::task-metadata[]
In the Mission Procedures section, metadata is associated with each task.

All tasks are assigned a preferred `role:` the Agent should assume in carrying out the task.
That role has further documentation at `.agent/docs/roles/<role-slug>.md`, and the executing agent should ingest that document entirely before proceeding.

Recommended collaborators are indicated by `with:`.

Recommended upgrades are designated by `upto:`.

Suggested skill/topic readings are indicated by `read:`.

Any working directories or files are listed in `path:`.
