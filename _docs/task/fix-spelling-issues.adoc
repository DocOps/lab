= Fix Spelling Issues
// We're going to author this doc with 2 audiences in mind, and we're going to tag it semantically with // tag::<subject>[] markers.
// The first audience is developers who want to understand how to implement a spelling issue fixer in DocOps Lab projects.
// The second audience is AI agents that will be able to read portions of this doc and learn to implement in DocOps Lab projects when prompted.

This procedure is to help you trace and fix spelling issues in documentation.
It uses DocOps Lab's custom Vale implementation to identify spelling errors and generate a report for correction.

You can then pass that report to an AI agent to help you fix the issues based on the data, your feedback, and further instructions.

[[error-report]]
== The Spellcheck Report

The report is a YAML file that lists the spelling issues found in your documentation.

Each entry in the sequence represents an issue detected by Vale, along with its context.


[[spellcheck-prompt]]
== The Spellcheck Prompt

The report will include a prompt that helps an AI agent understand the procedures for following up on your instructions.

.The default AI prompt
....
include::../../gems/docopslab-dev/assets/templates/spellcheck.prompt.yml[]
....

To override this prompt on a project level, configure it in your `.config/docopslab-dev.yml` file.
