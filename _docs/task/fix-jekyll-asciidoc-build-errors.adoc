When Asciidoctor errors are encountered during the conversion stage of a Jekyll build operation, use this procedure to clarify and fix them.


[[procedure-overview]]
== Procedure Overview

.PREREQUISITE
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure requires the link:{xref_docs_lab-dev-setup_url}[`docopslab-dev` utility].
====

// tag::procedure[]
. Perform a basic Jekyll build that writes verbose output to a local file.
+
.Example with config option
[.prompt]
 bundle exec jekyll build --verbose --config configs/jekyll.yml > .agent/scratch/jekyll-build.log 2>&1
+
Note the `2>&1` at the end of the command, which ensures that both standard output and error messages are captured in the log file.

. Run the analysis task on the exported file.
+
[.prompt]
 bundle exec rake 'labdev:lint:logs[jekyll-asciidoc,.agent/scratch/jekyll-build.log]'

. Open the YAML file relayed in the response message (example: `Jekyll AsciiDoc issues report generated: .agent/reports/jekyll-asciidoc-issues-20251214_085323.yml`).

. Follow the instructions in the report to address the issues found.
// end::procedure[]


[[error-report]]
== The Error Report

The report is a YAML file that lists the errors associated with their actual locations in the AsciiDoc source.

The report contains instructions so that it may be fed in its entirety to an LLM assistant to address the errors.
