DocOps Lab is committed to the strictest protections of user privacy.
This document outlines our privacy practices and the measures we take to ensure your data remains secure.

DocOps Lab software does not collect _any_ data from users through telemetry or other means, personally identifiable or otherwise.

If you use remote or third-party resources via DocOps Lab software, such as REST APIs, CI/CD platforms, or content delivery networks (CDNs), those services may collect data as outlined in their own privacy policies.
