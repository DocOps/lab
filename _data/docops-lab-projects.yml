# THE PLAN

# These are the projects I hope to release under the DocOps Lab umbrella.
# Broadly, they are the AYL DocStack ecosystem -- a series of frameworks,
#  utilities, libraries, and documentation for handling technical documents
#  like software source code.
# The biggest blocker is not having adocBook done, as it is going to be
#  the basis for most of the websites and example content presentation.
# Yet it is dependent on several other projects.
# But more broadly, the blocker is interdependency. So much of this depends on
#  the SchemaGraphy project, which is a ways from completion.
# The first and next major release will be the ReleaseHx utility, which has
#  SchemaGraphy built into it and needing to be spun off sometime after
#  ReleaseHx 0.1.0 goes GA.
# That gem also introduces Sourcerer, which is also a major dependency.

# RULES FOR THIS FILE
# 1. Each project should have a unique name and slug.
# 2. Each project should have a type, which is one of the types defined in
#    the $meta.types array.
# 3. Each project should have a description, which is a short summary of what
#    the project does.
# 4. Each project should have a version, which is a target version number, 
#    either in Semantic (SemVer) format or VN where N is a whole number.
# 5. Each project should have a wave.
# 6. Each project should have a done percentage, which is a percentage string
#    (0%-100%) indicating how complete the project is toward its 0.1.0 release.
#    Use "100%" for released projects.
# 7. Each project should have a tags array, which is an array of categorical
#    strings that the project meets as criteria, usually meaning:
#    "at leat part of this project _is_ or _does_ or _contains_ <tag>".
# 7A. Special Tags:
#     - "Dockerized" - indicates that the project has its own Docker image
#     - "DocOpsLab"  - the project is mainly meta or internal-facing
# 7B. Tags should never include the project type of their project, but if
#     there is crossover, tags may include OTHER types.
# 8. Each project should have a tech array, which is an array of technologies
#    used in the project, such as programming languages, frameworks, or libraries.
# 9. Each project should have an icon, which is a clevrely representative Lucide
#    icon name from: https://lucide.dev/icons
# 10. Each project should have a line, which is a short, one-line description of
#     the project, suitable for use in a list or summary.
# 11. Each project should have a deps array, which is an array of slugs
#     of other projects that this project depends on DIRECTLY.
# 12. Projects MAY have a note, which is a user-facing notice or comment.
# 13. Projects MAY have a repo property, which is ONLY needed if the repo is NOT DocOps/<slug>.
#     Format: Just the repo name (without 'DocOps/' prefix), or full path for non-DocOps repos.
#     Examples:
#       repo: schemagraphy         # means https://github.com/DocOps/schemagraphy
#       repo: lab                  # means https://github.com/DocOps/lab
#       repo: account/repo-name    # means https://github.com/account/repo-name
#       repo: https://example.com/repo.git  # full URL for non-GitHub repos
#     If omitted, the default repo is assumed to be https://github.com/DocOps/<slug>
# 13A. Projects MAY have a path property, which appends to the repo location.
#     Example: repo: lab, path: gems/docopslab-dev
#       Results in: https://github.com/DocOps/lab/tree/main/gems/docopslab-dev
# 14. Projects MAY have a live Boolean property indicating whether the repository
#     is publicly accessible on GitHub. This has nothing to do with release status,
#     only repo visibility. If omitted, assume false (repo is private or doesn't exist yet).
# 15. Projects MAY have a href property, which is a URL to the project's website
#     or documentation site. External URLs only (not GitHub repos).
# 16. Projects MAY have a text property, which which is to override the property's
#     actual name in displays on the website.
# 17. Projects MAY have a look, which is a short description of the project's appearance,
#     when relevant, such as a theme or design style.
# 18. Projects MAY have a card, which is a short, promotional description of the project
#     suitable for use on the landing page.
# 19. Projects MAY have a star Boolean to indicate if they should appear on the landing page.
# 20. Projects MAY have a memo, which is an internal-facing note or comment, not intended for
#     for users, but also not private.
# 21. Projects MAY have a subjects array, which is an array of objects defining
#     sub-projects or subject areas within the project.
# 22. Projects MAY have a packs array, which is an array of objects defining
#     sub-projects or subject areas within the project.
# 23. Projects MAY have a libs array, which is an array of objects defining technical libraries
#     supplied by the project.
# 24. Projects MAY have a methods array, which is an array of objects defining key technical methods
#     or endpoints in the project's API.
# 25. DO NOT use bold or italics in descriptions OR lines. Do use AsciiDoc syntax as needed (ex: "`curly quotes`").
