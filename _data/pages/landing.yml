      subtitle: Bridging the gap between documentarians and the world of code
      intro: |
        I am working to distribute the power of docs-as-code for non-developers.
        Too many technical writers, project managers, paralegals, researchers, and educators
        are stuck with legacy document tools that constrain their potential.

        Through several interconnected open source projects, I'm creating pathways for
        "tech-savvy non-programmers" to harness developer tools for document operations.

        The goal of DocOps Lab is to create a "docs-as-code" ecosystem (and community)
        that enables developers and non-developers alike to leverage modern documentation practices
        through a proper set of technologies, strategies, and conventions.
