properties:
  jekyll-ext: # root-level block for Jekyll extensions
    name: Jekyll Plugin-System Extension Settings
    desc: |
      General plugin settings that determine how the `jekyll-asciidoc-ui` plugin's JekyllExt API is used.    
    properties:
      copy_assets:
        dflt: ['jekyll-asciidoc-ui/assets/**/*']
        type: Array
        desc: |
          Array of assets paths (Globs) to copy from the plugin to the site.

          Glob Strings listed here will accumulate (all arrays will concatenate with duplicates dropped).
          Then copy operations will be performed on all paths for each gem that includes this gem.

          TIP: In order to ignore `jekyll-asciidoc-ui` gem assets, place your plugin's assets at a path other than lib/_assets and indicate your own path.

          If your plugin is a theme, Jekyll will use files from your gem's `./_includes` and `./_layouts` directories instead of the plugin's, when the config lists your theme as `site.theme`.
          This procedure copies the assets from `./lib/<path>` to the application codebase.

      stay_assets:
        dflt: ['jekyll-asciidoc-ui/assets/_includes','**/.*']
        type: Array
        desc: |
          Array of asset paths (Globs) not to copy from upstream plugins' lib/ directory.
          Use this to prevent the plugin from copying certain assets to the site, for unused or locally modified files.

          This will have no effect on a site theme's `_includes` and `_layouts` directories, which will always be used when not locally superseded.

      default_configs:
        dflt: [config-def.yml]
        type: Array
        desc: |
          Array of config definition files to pass to the runtime configuration. 
          Default configs must be in the experimental OpenCFGY (CFGYML) format.

          An empty Array (`[]`) disables the feature.

          Paths are relative to plugin's `lib/` directory.

          Plugin developers: Name your file something like `_config-def.yml` and place it in your plugin's `lib/` path to disable this plugin's config defaults, or override them specifically in your own copy of `lib/config-def.yml`.
          Use a path like `lib/my-plugin-name/config-def.yml` to allow downstream users to skip your config specifically.

      inherit_configs:
        dflt: true
        type: Boolean
        desc: |
          Whether to inherit configuration settings from upstream plugins.
          If set to `true`, the plugin will inherit settings from upstream plugins that use the `jekyll-ext` system.
          Otherwise it will fall back to the plugin defaults, followed up by your modifications and additions using `default_configs sibling property.

          End users (site admins) will be able to re-override this setting in their own config files.
  
  asciidoc-ui: # root-level block for AsciiDoc UI configuration
    name: User Interface Configuration
    desc: |
      Configuration options for the jekyll-asciidoc-ui plugin, which define the `site.asciidoc-ui` data object.
      This is the top-level configuration object for the plugin.
      The options in this object are used to configure the plugin itself, with `site.asciidoc-ui.components` enabling and configuring the included components and extensions.

            desc: |
              CSS selector for the container element(s) in which to apply the plugin.
              Designated elements will be affected by styles and scripts applied by the plugin.

              Defaults to any element with the class `asciidoc-html5`.
      
      libraries: # third-party frontend dependencies
        name: Third-Party Library Settings
        desc: |
          These settings establish how third-party libraries are handled.
          If a given library's `method` is set to `local`, the plugin will look for the library's assets in the local project.

          Assets can be handled in an of numerous ways:

          * Open-source CDN delivery straight to the user's browser
          * Compiled libraries served from your own website
          ** sourced in local path/submodule, _or_
          ** sourced from a remote URI, including `git@` protocols, and compiled into the project
          * Static artifacts stored locally or retrieved upon site build, served from your site

          The plugin will iterate through the libraries listed here and load them in the order they are defined.
          Users may add their own, arbitrarily named to suit the custom or additional library.

                  Change to a path relative to your domain if [.ppty]`method` is set to `compile` or `serve`.
              source_uri:
                type: URI
                desc: |
                  Optional URI for the source of assets to build.
                  This retrieves the source code from the source URI and compiles them into the project.

                type: String
                desc: |
                  Method for delivering library assets.
                  Options are:
                  
                  * `cdn` (default), for cloud-sourced asset delivery
                  * `compile` for local build from source files and served from site
                  * `serve` for local or retrieved static assets served from the site

                  If `cdn`, the base_uri must be a valid base URL for CDN delivery of the library.
                  If `compile`, the URI may be remote (URL or `git@` protocol) or local (path to submodule or local directory).
                  If `serve`, the source_uri must be a base URL or path to the assets to serve.

                  Remote assets are retrieved via curl for `serve` method, and for `compile` method:  git (if source is a git path), or else Ruby gem (via Bundler) or Node.js package (via npm).

                  For `serve` and `compile` methods, use a `base_url` relative to your own domain (`assets/css/bootstrap`).

              Array of component Slugs for activating non-default components or disabling default components.
              
              You can either use an explicit list of components to enable, or use special notation to add or subtract components to/from the default list.
        
              To enable components that are disabled by default, list them using a `+` prefix notation, like `[+releasehx, +glossary]`.

              Non-default components available for enabling:

              * `+releasehx`
              * `+glossary`
              * `+term-ext`
              * `+seo-ext`
              * `+gdpr-dialog`
              * `+gdpr-enforce`

              To disable components that are enabled by default, list them using a `-` prefix notation, like `[-clipable, -literal-prompt, +releasehx]`.

              If a component is listed here but not detailed as a sibling property in the [.ppty]`components` object, it will be activated with its default settings.
              
              Likewise, any property explicitly included as a sibling to this property will activate that component with the settings provided, unless that component also appears here with the `-` prefix, which will disable the component.

              For these settings, the "`default`" components list is modified by successive upstream dependencies.

              Adds glossary pages or documents to the site.
              The glossary page is a single page or series of pages listing and defining any terms added to the collection.

            docs: |
              Call using `{% include ui/glossary.html %}` in a page or layout file.

              The associated properties are for default/global glossary settings.

              You may pass these as arguments when including/rendering `ui/glossary.html`.

              You may also add arbitrary arguments either as properties of this ([.ppty']`asciidoc-ui.components.glossary`) object in the config file,
               or as additional variables to pass in the tag itself.

              For example, `{% include ui/glossary.html source="site.data.my-glossary" my_var="some value" %}`.

              These properties can also be set in any glossary data object, which are usually sourced like `data/glossary/product-a.yml`.

              The order of precedence for these settings is:

              . The tag itself, which overrides
              . The glossary data's `volume` object, which overrides
              . The config file

              Tags alone can additionally specify a `volume`, `categories`, `tags`, or `applications` arguments to filter the glossary terms displayed.

            docs: |
              Use the Jekyll frontmatter setting `:page-ppty-refs-coll:` to designate a default property collection for a given page.
              This specifies a collection to assume we are referencing when we invoke an inline property reference.

              [NOTE]
              A properties collection is basically any group of settings formatted using OpenCFGY (CFGYML) object format.

              * shows the basics of the property entry in a popover

              The `ppty-ext` component is enabled by default.

              Nested properties must be referenced fully, either in the content text or the role specifier.

                  The String to prepend to strings passed along with the `ppty` role.

                  For example, write `Document your [.ppty.ppty-api]*APIs* by...` to make sure `api` is expressed as the property ID.
                  
                  Alternatively, to use the syntax `[.ppty.ppty_api]*APIs* for the same result, change this setting value to `ppty_`.

                  Collection names must match an object at the path consisting of `<base_data_path>.<collection_name>`, where [.ppty.ppty-base_data_path]`<base_data_path>` is defined as a sibling to this property (defaults to `site.data`).

                        collections: [config, user-roles]
                  ----

                  When referencing a property in a collection not designated as the containing page's default collection, use the syntax `[ppty.pptycoll-config]+++`+++some-prop+++`+++` to indicate the property `some-prop` in the collection  named `config`.

                  Alternatively, use this `collections` property with an additional object mapping instead of an ArrayList in order to designate collections and declare alternate keys and other attributes of that collection.

                  For example:

                  [source,yaml]
                  ----
                  asciidoc-ui:

                            url_path: /users/roles
                  ----

                  For the above example, the `config` collection will be found at `site.data.conf` but be keyed as `pptycoll-cfg` (assuming [.ppty.ppty-ppty-ext_prefix]`ppty-ext.prefix` is `ppty-`).
                  The `users` collection will be found at `site.data.users`, and the reference docs will appear at a URL like `example.com/docs/settings/users/roles/`.

                dflt: 'site.data'
                type: String
                desc: |
                  Base path to the object containing the property data.
                  This is a dot-delimited Jekyll/Liquid-style data object reference that should always begin with `site.`.

                  The path, following the site `base_url`, to a page named after the designated collection.
                  So if the `site.base_url` is `/docs` and this (`base_url_path`) is `/settings`, links to properties in a given reference collection called `config` will point to an anchor in `example.com/docs/refs/config/`.

          inline-term:
            name: Inline Term Semantics
            desc: A term to highlight inline in the document body, optionally displaying or linking to a definition or description of that term.
            docs: |
              Add the `.term` role to any inline text element to make it a term link.

              [source,asciidoc]
              This is a paragraph with a glossary-defined [.term]*word* or [.term]*multi-word phrase*.

              Add an explicit slug to disambiguate the term if the wrapped text content is not exactly the term.
              In these cases, you will use the String designated by [.ppty]`inline-term.specifier` (defaults to `kee-`) followed by a hyphen and the term slug, as listed in the glossary.

              [source,asciidoc]
              This is a sentence with a [.term.kee-technology-stack]#tech stack#.

              Note that all of this inline syntax is unnecessary if you use the <<config_term-extension>> component, except to override its automated assignments or to add assignments to unconventional formulations of terms.
            properties:
              roles:
                dflt: [term]
                type: Array
                desc: |
                  Array of role names to use for terms.
              specifier:
                dflt: 'trm-'
                type: Slug
                desc: |
                  The String to use with an inline semantic like _term_ role, to designate how to signify a key being passed when it does not match the quoted word or phrase.

                  For example, `if you write [.term.trm-api]*APIs* but want to make sure `api` is the term matched in the glossary.
                  In this case, the [.ppty]`specifier` property must be set to `trm-` (the default).

          inline-file:
            name: File Semantics
            desc: Add the appropriate file icon to any mention of a file.
            docs: |
              Add the `.file` role to any inline text element to make it a file link.

              [source,asciidoc]
              This is a paragraph with a [.file]`path/to/file.yml` or [.file]`some-code.php`.

              For files without an extension, one can be appended to the role.

              Bundler looks for a [file.ext-rb]`Gemfile` to coordinate dependencies.

                dflt: [file,filename]
                type: Slug
                desc: |
                  The semantic role to indicate that the quoted string is to be treated as a file of a certain type.
              specifier:
                dflt: 'ext-'
                type: Slug
                desc: |
                  The String to use with an inline semantic like a _file_ role, to designate a missing or unexpected file extension.

                  For example, `if you write [.file.ext-rb]`./Gemfile` to indicate that the file is a Ruby file.
                  In this case, the [.ppty]`specifier` property must be set to `ext-` (the default).

          trademarker:
            name: Trademarker
            desc: Handle trademark ((TM)) symbols and trademarked terms.
            docs: |
              Add the `.tm` role to any inline text element to designate it as a trademarked term.

              [source,asciidoc]
              Our new product is [.tm-owner]#ACME# [.tm]#Terminus(TM)#, the last terminal emulator you'll ever need.

              Use the `.3p` class to designate a third-party trademark, which may be handled slightly differently, depending on configuration.

              It is recommended that you use the `.tm` role _and_ the +(TM)+ symbol in every instance of a trademarked term.

              Use `.tm-pending` to designate a trademark's status that is `pending`.
              By default, the status is `registered`.

              first_party:

                      Whether to mark the first occurrence of a first-party trademarked term in a given page with a trademark symbol, suppressing subsequent instances.
                      If set to `false`, all occurrences of first-party trademarks will be marked.

                      Whether or not to automatically treat all instances of the trademark as clipable text.
                      Effectively adds `.clip` role to each instance.
