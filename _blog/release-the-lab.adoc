{page-excerpt}

The site is heavily data driven, mainly based on a complex link:{this_repo_base_url}/blob/main/_data/docops-lab-projects.yml[YAML file] maintained for the past 2+ years to track projects, their relationships, progress, and so forth.
Now it informs a static website built with Jekyll and Asciidoctor, which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Check out the link:{this_repo_base_url}[Git repository and README] for more details.
Also link:/metablog/lab-projects-source-site/[this MetaBlog post] explores the source data and site generation in more detail.

The site now contains "`reports`", which group and arrange project status updates by various criteria, such as the link:/projects/by-type[type of application], the link:/projects/by-tech[technologies] involved, and the link:/projects/by-wave[target launch date].

Certain featured projects have their own profile pages, such as link:/projects/ayl-docstack/[AYL DocStack] and link:/projects/docs-as-code-school/[Docs-as-Code School], providing more details.

I am keeping this blog post short as a way of encouraging myself to post more frequently.

I will try to keep the progress of various DocOps Lab projects updated on the site, and I will also do my best to post more detailed updates here on the blog.
