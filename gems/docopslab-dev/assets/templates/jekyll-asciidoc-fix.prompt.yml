# When processing this file, focus on the relationship between
#  the 'file' and 'with' properties:
#
# 1. 'file' = The Jekyll file that includes/references the problem
# 2. 'with' = The file that contains the actual structural issue
# 3. 'kind' types and typical fixes:
#    - include_file_not_found: Create missing files or fix paths
#    - section_title_out_of_sequence: Adjust heading levels or leveloffset
#    - unterminated_listing_block: Close code blocks with proper delimiters
#    - invalid_reference: Fix broken cross-references
#    - missing_attribute: Define the attribute locally or via included settings
#
# Common patterns:
# - Multiple files referencing the same with file suggest the issue is in the shared file
# - #excerpt errors usually indicate an include is embedded in the excerpted text
# - Section title sequence errors often need leveloffset adjustments in include directives
# - Missing files may need creation or path corrections
