# Overview of Common Paths/Files in DocOps Lab Projects

This document is intended for AI agents operating within a DocOps Lab environment.

_If you are creating a new DocOPs Lab project_, use this guide to establish initial files. This also applies to adding major facilities or features to an existing project.

_If you are just getting to know a DocOps Lab codebase_, favor the project’s `README.adoc` file over this guide.

DocOps Lab projects tend to contain many of the same files across codebases. Documentation of these files in particular will be added when possible, but for now this basic guide will have to suffice.

## Documentation Paths

Only two files are required in _every_ DocOps Lab project, though most projects should contain most of these files, depending on the nature of the codebase. A `docs/` or `_docs/` directory is close to the third universal requirement, necessary by the time a project reaches version 1.0.0.

**`README.adoc`** :
   Project documentation in AsciiDoc format, providing an overview and instructions. DocOps Lab READMEs typically include single-sourcing data for the product as AsciiDoc attributes. See the Sourcerer project.

**`LICENSE`** :
   The project’s license file, specifying the terms under which the code can be used and distributed. Almost always **MIT License**.

**`docs/` / `_docs/`** :
   Directory for additional documentation, guides, and related materials. Typically `docs/` for product _user_ documentation, whereas `_docs/` is for (a) repos that are mainly for websites or (b) _internal engineering_ documentation files (more often found at `docs/_docs/`). Both might be present in the case of a website that hosts docs and _has its own_ docs.

   A `docs/` directory will typically have its own `Gemfile`, configs, and assets for Jekyll, Yard, and other generators. A `_docs/` directory is usually a content-only subordinate to the main project and its content, and may not have separate configs or assets.

## Configuration

**`.config/`** :
   Configuration files for tooling used in development, building, or QA/testing. Not always used.

   **`.config/releasehx.yml`** :
      Configuration file for ReleaseHx, a tool for generating release notes and changelogs.

   **`.config/jekyll.yml`** :
      Configuration file for Jekyll docs publication. For Jekyll extensions (themes and plugins), this file is typically `./_config.yml` to conform to Jekyll defaults.

   **`.config/vale.ini`** :
      Configuration file for Vale, a linter for prose, defining linting rules and styles.

**`.config/.vendor/`** :
   Directory for upstream configuration files, mostly or entirely managed by `docopsab-dev` gem. These files are not tracked in Git but are synced with upstream sources and maintained by DocOps Lab.

## Containerization

**`Dockerfile`** :
   Dockerfile for building the project’s Docker image, defining the environment and dependencies.

**`.dockerignore`** :
   Specifies files and directories to ignore when building the Docker image.

**`docker-compose.yml`** :
   Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications, _if applicable_.

## Ruby Files

These files are common to Ruby-based DocOps Lab projects. The `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` may be present in non-Ruby codebases that use Ruby development dependencies, such as ReleaseHx.

**`Gemfile`** :
   Ruby Bundler file, specifying gem dependencies for the project.

**`Gemfile.lock`** :
   Generated by Bundler, this file locks the gem versions used in the project.

**`.ruby-version`** :
   Specifies the Ruby version used in the project.

**`<gemname>.gemspec`** :
   Ruby gem specification file, defining the gem’s metadata and dependencies.

## Automation Paths

**`Rakefile`** :
   Ruby Rakefile for defining tasks and automation scripts.

**`scripts/`** :
   Custom scripts for automating tasks related to development, testing, and deployment.

**`.github/workflows/`** :
   GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, defining automated build, test, and deployment processes.

## Quality Assurance Paths

Any files containing _requirements_, _specifications_, _definitions_, _schemas_, or _tests_ should be stored in the `specs/` directory, as detailed in [DocOps Lab Testing & Specifications](/docs/testing/).

**`specs/`** :
   General directory for content that specifies, defines, or tests elements of the product. See [DocOps Lab Testing & Specifications](/docs/testing/).

   **`specs/data/`** :
      Definition and schema files.

   **`specs/tests/rspec/`** :
      RSpec tests for Ruby codebases.

   **`../<product-slug>-demo/`** :
      Major products typically have a sibling repo that serves as a proving grounds and/or for demonstrative purposes.

## Generative AI Paths

**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** :
   Instructions for GitHub Copilot, providing guidance on how any cloud-based GH Copilot assistance should be oriented toward a given codebase.

**`AGENTS.md`** :
   General for _local_ coding agents. May duplicate `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or provide additional context.

**`.agent/`** :
   A directory for temporary/scratch files used by local coding agents.
